This is the first public release of Tunelator, we hope it'll get to 
be usefull to many people and also that our users will help us 
make it better and more feature rich. Enjoy!

Though we know no obstacle that could avoid making Tunelator run under
other operating systems apart from Microsoft Windows, we have not made
tests yet. One future objective is releasing an installer at least
for Linux.

Tunelator is designed to be easily installed by end users. If you 
have a JRE 1.5 or later installed you can simply launch the installer
executable. 

To create an installation CD you'll need the following:

- The installer executable file: tunelator-0.3.0.exe
- The 'jre' folder resulting from the intallation of a Java JRE 1.5
- Although not necessary for the installer, we require that you
  place a copy of the License folder (license.zip file) in the installation 
  media to better convey the GNU GPL license terms.

Place all that in the same folder or burn it into a CD and you've got it.
Launch the installer and if the system does not contain a JRE it'll use 
the one it finds in the 'jre' folder to run.

The installer includes a JRE 1.5.0_06 with Java3D 1.3.2 installed on it,
that gets copied to the installation folder you choose during the installation.
You can substitute it by other JRE 1.5 or later and/or another Java3D version
but at your own risk. Please tell us at the forums if other combinations have
worked for you, or if you had to do it to solve a problem.

Tunelator uses the Java 3D version 1.3.2. Java 3D is reported to work with 
Nvidia and ATI cards (Catalyst 5.3 o posterior for Win32), and Matrox 
(with Z-Buffer turned on). There are some known issues, specially with some 
ATI cards; we can't test the program with a variety of cards as we'd like, but
will tryto help you solve the problems you find.

The solutions to these problems usually involve changing some parameter 
in your graphics card configuration or changing to a newer Java3D version.

Sharing your experiences you can help other users, and help us impove
Tunelator for you so we encourage you to participate in the proyect
forums.

- When in the preview tab, you can't change the width of the left

to Java 3D and Swing integration, so we can't solve it yet.
